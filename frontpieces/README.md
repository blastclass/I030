I think at one point I had written more disclaimers and intros than I had actual content in a form anyone might start to understand.

I was writing something that I knew that couldn't NOT be misunderstood.  I knew it would be like the first time I tried to read _Howl_.

I simply didn't have the references:

Howl
By Allen Ginsberg

For Carl Solomon
I

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,
who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,
who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,

etc.

A book that was more than I knew what to do with at the time.

I'm amused by things most people wouldn't get.  Some would say I have a unique perspective.  I say PERSPECTIVES.  Plural.

It took me years to master time travel, even though it is something we all do constantly.  I just don't recognize much what I call "Point C" thinking.

If we at A, and we're trying to get to C, there's infinite waypoints, and we're going to have to pick one.  If we're on the straight path . . .

When I hear the word "Universe" I hear One Verse.  But not even that.  Single Word.  All this is what happens as God begins to speak.

I've felt out-of-band for a while now.  I want to say it was 2010 or so when I started reading the WEF reports in a way that I could decode what was being said.

Galatians 5:1 For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.

I haven't really talked about Galatians and how I think we may get things a little less right than maybe we should.

You foolish Galatians! Who put you under a spell?

Was not Jesus the Messiah clearly portrayed before your very eyes as having been crucified? 

This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law,

or by the hearing of faith? 

Are you so foolish?

Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?

Have you suffered great things in vainâ€”if indeed it was in vain?

For through the Law I died to the Law so that I might live for God.

I have been crucified with the Messiah.

I no longer live, but the Messiah lives in me, 

and the life that I am now living in this body I live by the faithfulness of the Son of God,

who loved me and gave Himself for me.

I do not reject God's grace,

for if righteousness comes about by doing what the Law requires,

then the Messiah died for nothing.

I am astonished that so quickly you desert Who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel.

Which it is not.

Or you are troubled by those who desire to pervert the Gospel of Christ.

But if we, or even an angel out of heaven should preach a Gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you:

Accursed, let him be.  Anathema.

Whereas we have said before, and even now again I say:

If anyone is preaching a gospel to you contrary to what you received,

Accursed, let him be.  Anathema.

Am I now seeking the approval of men?  Or of God.

Do I wish men be pleased?

For if to please man, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.

. . .Paul mentions Arabia. . .

But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,

To reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles.

I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood,

nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those apostles before me;

But I went to Arabia. . .

And that was the bit that got me.  

Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.

Paul was gone three years, at least first to Arabia from Damascus, but returning to Damascus at some point.

Cultural and Historical Background: Arabia in biblical times was a vast and diverse region, home to various tribes and cultures. It was known for its trade routes, including the famous incense and spice routes. The region played a significant role in the ancient world due to its strategic location and resources. The Nabateans, a prominent Arab kingdom, controlled much of the trade in the area during the time of the New Testament.

There's Christian sites for the study of Jewish texts, but there is no Islamic site dedicated to studying any of the previous scriptures, even though the
