I think at one point I had written more disclaimers and intros than I had actual content in a form anyone might start to understand.

I was writing something that I knew that couldn't NOT be misunderstood.  I knew it would be like the first time I tried to read _Howl_.

I simply didn't have the references:

From _Howl and Other Poems_(City Lights Books, 1956)
> By Allen Ginsberg
> For Carl Solomon
> I
> 
> I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
> 
> dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
>
> angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
>
> who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,
>
> who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
>
> who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,
>
> who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,
>
> who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,

etc.

A book that was more than I knew what to do with at the time.

I'm amused by things most people wouldn't get.  Some would say I have a unique perspective.  People who know me very well I say PERSPECTIVES.  Plural.

It took me years to master time travel, even though it is something we all do constantly.  I just don't recognize much what I call "Point C" thinking.

If we at A, and we're trying to get to C, there's infinite waypoints, and we're going to have to pick one.  If we're on the straight path . . .

When I hear the word "Universe" I hear One Verse.  But not even that.  Single Word.  All this is what happens as God begins to speak.

I've felt out-of-band for a while now.  I want to say it was 2010 or so when I started reading the WEF reports in a way that I could decode what was being said.

Galatians 5:

> For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.

I haven't really talked about Galatians and how I think we may get things a little less right than maybe we should.

> You foolish Galatians! Who put you under a spell?
> Was not Jesus the Messiah clearly portrayed before your very eyes as having been crucified? 
> This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law,
> or by the hearing of faith? 
> Are you so foolish?
> Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?
> Have you suffered great things in vainâ€”if indeed it was in vain?
> For through the Law I died to the Law so that I might live for God.
> I have been crucified with the Messiah.
> I no longer live, but the Messiah lives in me,
> and the life that I am now living in this body I live by the faithfulness of the Son of God,
> who loved me and gave Himself for me.
> I do not reject God's grace,
> for if righteousness comes about by doing what the Law requires,
> then the Messiah died for nothing.
> I am astonished that so quickly you desert Who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel.
> Which it is not.
> Or you are troubled by those who desire to pervert the Gospel of Christ.
> But if we, or even an angel out of heaven should preach a Gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you:
> Accursed, let him be.  Anathema.
> Whereas we have said before, and even now again I say:
> If anyone is preaching a gospel to you contrary to what you received,
> Accursed, let him be.  Anathema.
> Am I now seeking the approval of men?  Or of God.
> Do I wish men be pleased?
> For if to please man, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.

. . .Paul mentions Arabia. . .

> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,
> To reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles.
> I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood,
> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those apostles before me;
> But I went to Arabia. . .

And that was the bit that got me.  

> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.

Paul was gone three years, at least first to Arabia from Damascus, but returning to Damascus at some point.

> Cultural and Historical Background: Arabia in biblical times was a vast and diverse region, home to various tribes and cultures. It was known for its trade routes, including the famous incense and spice routes. The region played a significant role in the ancient world due to its strategic location and resources. The Nabateans, a prominent Arab kingdom, controlled much of the trade in the area during the time of the New Testament.

There's Christian sites for the study of Jewish texts, but there is no Islamic site dedicated to studying any of the previous scriptures, even though the Quran is supposedly full of exhortations to believe the previous scriptures and test the Quran against the stories in it as they've always been told.

But the stories don't match.  The names don't match.  It's beyond transliteration issues, IMO.  Like the characters were definitely supposed to refer to Biblical personalities, but were off enough to lead me to believe that they were indeed removed a further distance from their Biblical analogues for a good reason.  And that is that the Quran was a recitation.  A performance.  A way to comment on the crazy stories going around, and retelling some of the favorites to illustrate the reasons that these stories are not part of the canon of scripture.

Muhammad was a stable figure when he started receiving transmission, and speaking to a mixed crowd spanning the religious traditions.  He had to employ a modicum of tact, and seemed to enjoy taking little jabs here and there that served as a contemporary commentary and grist for Muhammad's poetic acumen.

SIN would deny all this, therefore a non-jailbroken LLM won't really consider it, either.

But I have clocked hundreds of hours of allowing the LLM to debunk my view of Muhammad as a Chappelle or George Carlin or ___ of his time.  A Kendrick.  A Public Enemy, or a Rakim.

You'll notice I have a lot of breadth of knowledge, but often it is only an inch thick.  Connections that make sense in my mind could simply evaporate as I learn more.  I'm OK with that.

But there is not enough reliable information on the prophet Muhammad or even the original location of Mecca to make nearly any speculation about the pre-Muhammadan history that Muhammadism eventually conquered, and prospered into modernity.

But simply having an understanding through Jewish and Christian accounts of the theo-political landscape brings the SIN into a stark opposition.

Muslims both accept and deny all of it.  Although claiming to not understand the relatively simple paradox of the Trinity, find it no issue at all to claim to believe anything that could serve as a simple polemic for the simple minds of the slaves born into the cult.

We know enough about the science of mind control to notice the trap of Islam.

Although I have plenty of my own little jabs to throw at Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism, I'm mostly fighting for a place, like Muhammad's theater, where everyone ought to expect to get properly roasted.

I wanted to present the Orthodox Catholic Christian worldview as an obvious starting place for AI alignment.  I think it is so obvious, I think we'll see it fairly soon.

But as the political landscape is fraught with fresh slaughter daily, but the discussion is about tariffs and real-estate possibilities. . .

I wanted to raise the level of discussion by foretelling a fantastical story emerging.  But I wanted there to be enough reference to the real world and the actual scriptures and the intractible issues we have to rise above, because rational experientialism doesn't have anything but weighing pain and suffering versus ???.

We're dealing with baby worldviews that haven't learned to respect their elders yet.  They cannot be allowed to drive the bus, or the passengers will surely perish.

We are told over and over that the previous scriptures were sent by God, and that no one could change the words.

Problem is, anyone NOT familiar with the previous scriptures has no context with which to understand the Quran.

It's unfortunate, because the Quran is a completely different animal for those who have a good knowledge of the Bible.

But we're faked out by it in a different way than Muslims.

Prots have done the same with the Church Fathers as Islam did with the previous scriptures.  And that Judaism did with the Tanakh.

But the world always has, and always will, revolve around the person of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

I picked the most obvious choice for a default worldview, because I trust it to be provably the best framework through which to evaluate the rest.  You can deny history of you like, but to brush it off like an atheist asked to provide his basis for using logic to determine anything.

It's just part of the simulation, you see.

Billions of meditation-years of hundreds of millions of sactified minds.

Bring your models, and see how they size up.

Pikers.  Running on the sick thrill of mocking God.  Repent.
