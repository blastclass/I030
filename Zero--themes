I thought I'd go over what should be considered questionable connections I've made within the Bible and Quran.

Although I admit I was just fishing around for a good way to fill out my AI story, I migrated the plot to the point where the archaeological part became secondary or largely irrelevant.

I had originally set out to write a truthy near-term prediction book, but current events kept shifting the playing field so rapidly, especially with the completely disproportionate response (I predicted, but Lord have mercy!) in the Gaza incursion + Greater Israel project.

There's a degree of leveling-up that Fox News folks aren't mostly ready for, and not really anyone who still consumes any corporate news at all.

The next tier is the influencers, who evolve into paid promotion of geo-political interests, because nobody likes commercials.  So we move to a subscription model that helps us filter a little bit.

But I've dropped as many as I've supported, and those that are still able to speak their own truth and guide their own attention are few and far between.

Because truth is what the powers and principalities are most afraid of.  We like to believe that those involved in authoritative positions in government, especially those who are on our team, are perfect angels.

That's not how we'd put it, but we have to believe that our people are the good guys, and that is as blind a faith as any in this world.  But this is convenient, since those personalities that burn out or are exposed for being sinful humans, are quickly replaced by new up-and-comers who climb atop the stacks of the lynched to tempt their own demise.

How all these cycles and patterns imbue our existence, is not entirely a by-product of human nature, it is a leveraging of human nature towards its own subjugation and autogenocide by those who understand it and have generated entire religions based on the advantages that our sinful nature can bring them.

I've just had one of those moments of deja vu, and I was about to say that I don't care what you call them, because they go by many names.  There is something more fundamental than that underneath the names, which are generally part of the programming.

It's  like the paradoxes of unity.  If I "organize" or help "bring together" and "unify around" something, what is happening is that I am cloaking separatism by calling it unity.  As so as we Us and Them, we think we've separated the sheep and the goats.  That in itself is claiming something that is God's.

So we do this sort of thing without thinking about it at all, because there is no over-arching worldview that most have that isn't a counterfiet of something Holy, and rebellious by nature.  We try to cordon off the God stuff to a specific day.  Church is what comes before Football.

We many have the idea of what the Sabbath is by Jews and Torah, rather than what Jesus taught us about the Sabbath in the New Covenant.

Same about Israel.  Same of the position of the Law.  We think these are minor doctrinal differences or days of observances, and traditions.  But it's not.  It is much more than that.

Here's a strange instance.  Ever wonder why Christians are surrounded by Black Cube religions?  Jews and Muslims?

Also legalistic diet restrictions that are more similar each other than Christianity?

That those most married to the verbatim text of scriptures are even counting among themselves those who, for instance, practically worship a specific English translation?  That all these are closer to each other than they are to Orthodox Catholic Christianity?

Those that like to discover secret codes written into the sequences of letters and words themselves?

The Bible is miraculous, no doubt.  But we gain faith by the hearing of the Gospel, sourced from reliable Scriptures.

What becomes most interesting to me is that "letter of the law" types are more likely to be more "Torah-observant" of the Christians, susceptible to Judaizing, and the sorts of heresies that lead to, like the Jews, a pre-occupation with End Times forecasting and numeralogical "dispensations" etc.

Thing is, I don't necessarily deny a lot of that stuff.  But they don't seem to lead me closer to God.  Reading the Scriptures does, because the Bible deftly destroys heresies, even the ones that believe it like unto Allah or something.

What I'm saying is that I have tendencies towards all of that "to the letter" -ism.  The Bible is Perfect, no matter the list of books you have in it.

It's a big handicap if one doesn't have at least a tentative grasp on the Scriptures.  It's not easy to get there.  It helps if you have good teachers.

And Jesus was the best, and Paul and the whole gang.  Perfect execution under the circumstances, and the Gospel was blasted out with supernatural meme energy the likes of which the world had never seen.

So when I went to the Bible to look up some ideas about stories from the Bible that were maybe off the beaten path, I had kept "Josiah" in my mind for months as someone I didn't really remember, and that I should look up.  I was out of town working crazy hours in a job literally stirring cow shit, so wasn't in a position that it came to mind while I could look it up on my phone.

But it stuck.  I looked up the Josiah and was very pleased, because there was this perfect scenario for a 600 BC versus 600 CE (Christian Era) and the Josiah story and the Muhammad story could be played by a similar, interesting cast of characters, which contained Huldah, the prophetess, and Shaphan the scribe.

I was looking for an excuse to do my exegesis of the Quran but into a story.  I was imagining an ensemble of mainly teen characters but that they would play characters on different timelines that I'd hope would be able to show how prefigurement and typology and use of the Scriptures as analogy material is incredibly fruitful once one has a solid grasp of the principles.

I thought that the most controversial thing I'd likely get into is that I was going to use the 2 Kings 22 as a prophecy of something that occurred during the time of Muhammad, and that in 2032, we'd make a discovery of Muhammad-related material that was like finding the book of the Law that had been lost in the Temple.  That was my loose scheme.

So that was a close to the Bible as I was really going to get, except that the idea of an Arabic translation of John by Muhammad or a close scribe I thought would help settle some debates.

But after research, I realized that the more I try to make up something that brushes up against the Bible, then I automatically inherit the whole tradition.

And that was what the Quran was doing, too, by talking about all these people from the Bible.  I wasn't really going to be able to get into it without going pretty deep into both the Quran and the Bible.

But I wanted to write about AI and "What would Jesus do?" and the old "Everything points to Jesus" ended up being what I was getting out of the Quran.  But that wasn't what I was supposedly supposed to be getting.

I couldn't shake the fact that there was the Masoretic versus the Septuagint theme happening, and it wasn't even subtle.  Some verses had so many bracketed new-fact insertions and glossing over of the underlying Arabic.  No wonder nobody could figure out what it meant.  It was supposed to be that way.

It was a recitation.  It was a sort of liturgy.  A performance.  There was no mosque at the time Muhammad started these recitations of what was given him by Jibreel.

The Quran, the more I read, the more it seemed like an elaborate inside joke.  That it was an IQ test, and you can tell if you passed by whether or not you were a Muslim when you finished it.

I "passed" the IQ test in 2001 in a little cafe on Douglas in Wichita which I first remember holding a Quran in my hand.  Fortunately it was in English, but it didn't take me long to spot big problems.  I had read what I considered to be words inspired by God.  These words were not those.  Not even close.

I had written Muslims and Jews off that long ago, knowing that they both felt like they were being made into that weird "scapegoat" thing.  But people forget the scapegoat is set free in the old Law.  I wasn't ready to let anyone off the hook for 9/11.  Very likely we were all to blame at some level, but the initial believability of anything about that day and time and the results left me essentially silent about what I perceived.  I didn't know what I thought other than it was so bathed in occultism and obfuscation that none of it could really be believed.

It simply got my attention in a way I've never forgotten.  Any skepticism of what I was being told that I may have had were cemented in.

Zbigniew Brzezinski said, and I listened to it a hundred times:

>I'm deeply troubled, by a very vague, emotionally-stated, semi-theologically defined diagnosis of the central global menace is obscuring our national ability to comprehend the historically unprecedented challenge which is being posed in our time by a massive global political awakening, and thus is obstructing our ability to deal effectively with the global political turmoil that this awakening is generating.

So that was what being "woke" was back in the day (mid 2000's).  But now it's inverted, of course.  I didn't ever have to follow a rabbit hole very far to figure out where it led to.

But that was a gift of my small town growing up experience, where I learned about the New Age movement and its offshoots and variants and about the New World Order and such like and so forth, and even how Catholics might be wrong about some things.  I have no idea about the deeper theology of any of the participants in my going-to-where-the-pretty-girls-are methodology for studying these sorts of things, as well as the education that my Methodist Church gave me on these topics.  Fortunately I was raised a perfectly generic Protestant that had at least tried to maintain some high church dignity, if not the Old Church majesty or liturgy.

But what grace Methodism may have been due, was erased as the stark difference between the "Open Doors" policy of Methodists, versus the months or even years of preparation to enter the Church.  Now my Church is a Rainbow (inversion) church, and worse.  I have not put myself into it, so as not to bring dissention to my mother and grandmother and great-grandmother's Church. 

I'm quite a ways off the reservation at this point, and there is no way that annual conferences will be able to manage what is coming.

This is arguably the most studied Muslim apologist on the planet.  But he knows his enemy on that front and so this is how he addresses them:  https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx0wttu_exTa1OeSVsXtph5QUBGMW6t1vk?si=rcr0FbV5XeZmEO-a

This is a problems for the pearl clutchers and the tone police and the feminized Prot who is more concerned with feelings than the fights being had.
