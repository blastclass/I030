Reminds me of Quran about "Don't say 'three!' . . . it would be better for you.

Which I read as a warning not to comment on Trinitarian theology unless you know what you're saying.

Most Christians don't have a firm grasp of that topic, or why it's even a topic at all.

But without that, the Bible is a little bit confusing in places.  A confusion that 2nd Temple Jews were still trying to resolve.

Jesus Christ and later the Apostles solved that, and the Church Fathers refined it into a powerful hermeneutic.

Those that deny it, would have been tripped up by something else, anyway, is what I expect.

Because it shows a distrust of authority that I would normally applaud if it were mere earthly matters and barely elected hucksters.
