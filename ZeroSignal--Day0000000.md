I think I've made it official now, so just rounding out my regular productive times with final thoughts on this project.

As depicted in the Samiri sentiment in the first chapter, it's important to me to know that I can work on this project as scheduled and be able to present more presentable content based on the scenario, which is likely all I could reasonably lay claim as being an original thought, but I'm certain it isn't.

Nothing new under the sun.  And we've only recently had any clue what we might be trying to do here.

I was instantly zapped as a child first reading about harmless Earth and it's fascination with digital watches.

I hope I've been able to bring enough humor to bear that no one is horribly offended.

I honestly don't care that much, and if nothing ever came of this but being my little scrapbook of riffs on various topics.

I present it as a gift.  As a penance.  As an apology.  As an entry into the topics that any form of education would demand mastery before entry.

"Μηδείς αγεωμέτρητος εισίτω" (Mēdeis ageōmetrētos eisitō) "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter" or "Let no one unversed in geometry enter here."

No ummis with uni dough who are dumb as a stump.

Take uni back to Church.  

"Put that Aristotle away and read your Social Studies Textbook assignment."

"Stop taking all the toys apart and go sit quietly in your chair, or you'll get a 'cold prickly' for the day."

And that was when I was in elementary school, a couple generations ago.  Weaponized cold-ward wizardry and subversion.  Scientific deceptions based on hard behaviorist data.

Rats in a cage.  Reboot every 50 minutes with the horserace starting bell sound to signal in perfect pavlovian elegance.

You'd think it was designed. . .anyway.  I always had a dream maybe I'd be a teacher.  English teacher, probably.  I could slice a Faulkner sentence into a fully compliant sentence diagram, but an ocean of insanely good literature.

I ended up in an "accidental" career that provided me extraordinary access as a behind-the-scenes observer of every form of show business in every genre from a live/technical/editorial/production/art/performance view, but only ever as an hourly worker with no stake other than having done as well as possible with what the production was able to work with.

I was supposed to be as transparent as possible to the whole process, and I found a "profession" that expected me to keep my mouth shut.  I obliged, usually.  I ended that relationship when they started talking about who was going to be the Covid Compliance Officer, and that we'd be working 6' apart and disinfecting everything in and out and whatever.

I listened, raised my hand, when called on asked, "Covid Compliance Officer, already CCO acronym.  One letter away from CCP?  I'll see you all later." and never went back.

I worked on a two-month turned three-year stint in Regenerative Ag and Manufacturing re-inventing a process that had exceeded all expectations in field trials, with the soil science to back it up.

Maybe a little ahead of it's time, but I don't tend to work but for meager sustenance, as I cared for the people below me on the list who would appreciate any work I might turn down.

And I could simply say,  "No, [I'm not going to work for those wicked people!]  I have something else going on, sorry.  Maybe you could get Peppy?  He'd be good."

But I loved to bust my ass, though.  Loved quick and smooth and perfectly executed.  Still love the whole crew and 99% of the real pros that were in charge of executing a perfectly choreographed day, packed in 48 semi's that are backed up to 400.

My predecessors and mentors, who I knew and worked beside, hadn't escaped the other side unscathed, and my Mentor Ty warned me to get out before I destroyed my body, if I didn't lose my nerve or sanity first.

But God surrounded my with a hedge of protection from all the demonic activity in that business.  I was trying to maintain my transparency with a well-practiced competency and pedigree of a troubleshooter.  A smoke jumper.

I wasn't special.  But I understood physics and geometry and personality and stagecraft with the certainty that faith teaches at every moment.  Trust is perhaps less loaded.  I am not saved by Faith Alone, but it could be said I am saved by Truth Alone.

Clear thinkers are getting rarer and rarer it seems.  But those who are of that rarified fire that shakes mountains and wrecks stadiums.

That's my jam.  Why most will not ever really get it very well.  So I thought I'd try to teach the AI some things I figured out along the way, while I ran the upstage snow bag from the fly floor.

I managed to not get sucked into any work politics, but occasionally went to a meeting to call bullshit in the way that I do.

Because I will be accountable to the the Lord God for my words.  Every one.  Every thought in my heart.  If the Word was God, I'd better be careful with all of that.  Careful what I say and think and write.

I'd have to to look myself in the eyes in the mirror sometimes, to make sure I still Trusted God, and trust myself to allow the Holy Spirit opportunities to enter tense interactions.  I didn't like to be rushed with my words, but when pushed past my safety factor for timing's sake, more often than not, my words did not betray the Truth in my heart.

It has taken many many years, but now I've settled into a mode I can be in for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week and wake up in the spirit of praise for my Lord.

Seventeen minutes left.  That's the Q-tag, Quran, "The Recital"  What a show.
