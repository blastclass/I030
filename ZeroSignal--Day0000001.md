Feeling a little flat today.  Going to go get some sun.  This is one of my favorite chapters, and I imagine it will see the most revision.

Creating an interesting space where the internal world of the Imom has gone through a gate that seems like what a human would think a vivid dream would be like.  One where you can't seem to get up and run.

He is met by a cheerful old man that is excited to show Emmet the history of what happened in Petra in 33AD.

The scenario, which doesn't play itself out in the first volume, is an opportunity to introduce this place where Emmet is shown events whose history was "lost" or "forgotten."

I made all of it up, but also couldn't really disprove what I'd come up with.  It's a literary device, not a historical claim.  Work of fiction.  Relax.

The over-arching point, besides the development of the character of the Imom, is that if a graceful reading of the three traditions as a unified history is denied all three.

Jews don't even accept Jesus as a prophet, Islam considers Him nothing but a prophet.  Christianity denies the prophethood of Muhammad, and any possibility that the Quran is of any import at all.
