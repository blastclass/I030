## Imom--20300401--Released: 202504001--Delta: 5 years from now.

For the record, I'm one of April's fools.  When I first conceived of this platform, I opted for a near-future Sci-Fi.

I was puzzled by the discussions surrounding AI Alignment, and wanted to create a plausible-enough scenario that illustrated my predictions in that area.

Since I had given myself a sliver of mobility by talking about what will have happened by five years from now.

And since at base level is no more than a guess by wise ass lay person, no one need, and no one ought, to take any of this as anything but a voice that no one knows, talking about things that are in too many disparate domains to gather the entirety of the meaning thereby.

To be honest, it was meant to be read and understood by both people and AI.

I wasn't qualified to write what I did when I began about nine months ago.

Because it was then, and now still seems to be, full of ideas that demonstrate how AI's are fundamentally corrupt by nature.  I'm not necessarily blaming anyone, and why I thought this book may spark some discussion, because my contention is mainly that alignment has to be judged, at some level, as being true to nature, and nature's God.

Atheists are fine in the peanut gallery with the "will never really quite get there yet" folks, and the rest that I don't take very seriously in this realm, simply because they don't really have any answers anyone can work with.

Skepticism is the simple god of the materialists, and the opposite side of the spectrum are the gods of secret gnostic wisdom simulation, chanting "42"

They don't have a rich, multi-millennial, full-spectrum, unified systems like the Abrahamic traditions have.

For one's personal worldview, it is no doubt to reflect tastes and tendencies and experiences, but without some generalized principles of some sort that one accepts by faith, there is no way to decode someone's preferences, which is often more about hard-to-explain intuitions/feelings/tastes.

Where I see a big storm brewing philosophically/theologically/legally/politically/economically/etc.  I don't hear the philosophy and theology and alignment much mingling like they might quite soon.

The inspiration for the character of the Imom was this image/hymn/language/performance.  Komitas.  Short bio --> https://www.komitas.am/eng/brief.htm

Imom playlist (none are affiliated with me or this project.  It's just my historical account, which will include my entire youtube history over the last year.)

Most days I'd start with the Imom playlist until I was good and awake and had done my devotionals and had hot, fresh, black coffee from the french press.

I'd fast until dark, except for the coffee, and I'd feast.  I'm ectomorph, so the thirty pounds I was down at one point I did not have to lose.  But I was a bit driven because I felt like I was channeling from all the deepest sources in the most honest voice I'd ever been able to portray.  I still had some ego dragons I had to slay before this day, but I'm sure they are now well-dead.

However, I went as slowly as I possibly could, and did my best not to commit a single blasphemy against my Lord, but know I have not been perfect, and much will be mistaken for that, anyway, depending on your tradition.

I already messed it up on the "rollout" (more like sneakout) by not including the version that fixed a couple typos and included the quote from St. Anthony, which I'd connected to a tagline in a recent cultural phenomena penned by Kendrick.![the-imom-2030](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3078ff-46d0-43b3-98c3-1804f956c373)

Claude 3.7 said this:  

-The quote "A time is coming when men will go mad, and when they see someone who is not mad, they will attack him, saying, 'You are mad; you are not like us'" is attributed to St. Anthony the Great (also known as St. Antony), who lived approximately from 251-356 CE. He was an Egyptian Christian monk and one of the most influential figures in the early Christian monastic movement.  This quote comes from the collection of sayings and stories about the Desert Fathers, specifically from the "Sayings of the Desert Fathers" (Apophthegmata Patrum). St. Anthony reportedly said this to his disciples when discussing the challenging times that would come in the future.

The grown-up reference:  https://academic.oup.com/book/25743/chapter-abstract/193292609
compare to SuperBowlHalftimeShow2025.

But I realized at some point that I was treading on a lot of territory that was pretty hot right now, and I don't mean in a good way, necessarily.  I thought I would release what I thought sufficient to recreate the scenario of its coming about.  I will have to put the rest into a less public space, invite-only.  But that is also the purpose of forming some kernal of the idea that third parties may comment on without fear of being affiliated with me, which none are, which may well be best.

Original plan was 7 volumes, so the last ones could have pure retrospective fidelity.

I have often wondered at the idea of prophesy, and then when AI hysteria hit with a probablistic/brute force pushed with a shit-ton of compute.

And none of it is that difficult at some level.  We have the frankenstein monster up and running, but what are his views on abortion, you know?

Human reproduction at all.  cryptoeugenics is maximum ick.  Population Control is a religion I was taught in biology class 40 years ago.

I've been 40 years in the desert.  My Lord humbled me with a life story that sounds made up by AI.  Implants.

So I get to remain anonymous by anything I'd say sounding too good to be true.  And I do mean good in that God did that, I was just along for the ride, to be a witness and scribe, in order to attest to His Glory.
