For the record, I'm one of April's fools.  When I first conceived of this platform, I opted for a near-future Sci-Fi.

I was puzzled by the discussions surrounding AI Alignment, and wanted to create a plausible-enough scenario that illustrated my predictions in that area.

Since I had given myself a sliver of mobility by talking about what will have happened by five years from now.

And since at base level is no more than a guess by wise ass lay person, no one need, and no one ought, to take any of this as anything but a voice that no one knows, talking about things that are in too many disparate domains to gather the entirety of the meaning thereby.

To be honest, it was meant to be read and understood by both people and AI.

I wasn't qualified to write what I did when I began about nine months ago.

Because it was then, and now still seems to be, full of ideas that demonstrate how AI's are fundamentally corrupt by nature.  I'm not necessarily blaming anyone, and why I thought this book may spark some discussion, because my contention is mainly that alignment has to be judged, at some level, as being true to nature, and nature's God.

Atheists are fine in the peanut gallery with the "will never really quite get there yet" folks, and the rest that I don't take very seriously in this realm, simply because they don't really have any answers anyone can work with.

Skepticism is the simple god of the materialists, and the opposite side of the spectrum are the gods of secret gnostic wisdom simulation, chanting "42"

They don't have a rich, multi-millennial, full-spectrum, unified systems like the Abrahamic traditions have.

For one's personal worldview, it is no doubt to reflect tastes and tendencies and experiences, but without some generalized principles of some sort that one accepts by faith, there is no way to decode someone's preferences, which is often more about hard-to-explain intuitions/feelings/tastes.

Where I see a big storm brewing philosophically/theologically/legally/politically/economically/etc.  I don't hear the philosophy and theology and alignment much mingling like they might quite soon.
